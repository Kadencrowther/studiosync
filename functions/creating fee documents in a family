Let me help think through this logic for each association type:
Season Association:
When a fee is created and associated with a season mid-season:
We need to find all students who are in ANY class in that season
Then find all families that have those students
Add the fee to each family's Fees subcollection
The fee should reference which student it's for and which season it came from
Class Association:
When a fee is created and associated with a specific class mid-season:
We need to find all students currently enrolled in that class
Then find all families that have those students
Add the fee to each family's Fees subcollection
The fee should reference which student it's for and which class it came from
Family Association:
This is the simplest case
The fee would be added directly to the specified family's Fees subcollection
No need to look up students or classes
The fee would apply to the whole family (not tied to a specific student)
Student Association:
When a fee is associated with a specific student:
We find that student's family
Add the fee to their family's Fees subcollection
The fee should reference which student it's for
For all these cases, when adding the fee to a family's Fees subcollection, we need to:
Create the proper payment schedule (one-time or recurring)
Set the correct start date (current date)
Handle any end dates for recurring fees
Set the proper status (Unpaid for future payments)
Would you like me to start implementing this logic? We can begin with one association type first to make sure the pattern works correctly.
